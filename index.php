        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our website, glad you were able to find us! We are college students who were tired of having multiple tabs open while studying and tired of our friends
            complaining about all the tabs open on their computer.
            We each have very different ways of studying, both of our favorite method is the pomodoro method, this is usually a 2 hour long study session 
            that has 25 minute study sections and 5 minute breaks between. After two hours you get a 15 minute break! We attached this method on the main page. 
            There are so many different study methods it's hard to find which one is right for you.
            Which is why we did a little reserach and found studying techniques for everyone. If you're not sure what study method is best for you then look at our
            study tip page where we have nine amazing techniques that will keep you focused and get your work done. In our website you will find there are
            multiple different pages so you can have the study layout of your dreams. We do have a little fireplace that runs for up to 10 hours! Lofi music playing in the background or have soothing rain noises. 
            Additionally during your study breaks we have added a MadLib area to keep you off your phone and your mind running. 
            After completing the madlib you'll get an email with your results. Lastly, we have a data page which is a work in progress and more data will be uploaded.
            But this page showcases stats about listening to music and studying and other studying statistics. We hope that you enjoy our website if 
            there are any questions of concerns or suggestions reach out to us!
